# Roborio-to-Arduino-Light-Control

Hi!

This is an Experiment that me and my FRC team did we are using an Arduino to control a NeoPixel Light Ring for Camera Tracking on our robots. Its Mainly for Looks but also serves the benifit of changing the color if a competiton has a weird lights near the goal.


File Descriptions:

  LED_Light_I2C	(Slave-Input Preset Colors)
  
  LED_Light_I2C_MasterTestor (Master-Output Preset Colors)
  
  LED_Light_I2C_RGB (Slave-Input RGB)
  
  LED_Light_I2C_RGB_MasterTestor (Master-Output RGB)
  
  LED_Light_with_PWM (Takes in PWM or AnalogWrite)
  
  Light_Ring_Loading (Light Ring Loading Test)
  
  Loading (Light Ring Loading Test)
  
  PWM_Read (PWM Read Test) {BROKEN}
